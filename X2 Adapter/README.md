# X2 Adapter
This adapter replaces the CSTLS4M00G56 ceramic resonator. I found CSTCR4M00G55B95 as a good replacement.

## Gerber Files
There are two files in [Gerber Files](./Gerber%20Files/):
1. Single Board - Only consist of just one board.
2. Panelized - Consist of multiple board to fit in a 100mm x 100mm board. The panel have 90 (10x9) adapters. It is panelized using mouse bites.

## Assembly Tips
If you're using the right angle header pins, put the longer pins on the adapter side so you save a tiny bit of vertical space then you can just trim the pins off.
