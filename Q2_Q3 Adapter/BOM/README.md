> The BOM only lists for 1 adapter, if you want to use the adapter for Q2 and Q3 on OpenTendo, you have to buy 2 of the transistors. Please read the note below about the header pins.

| Reference | Qty | Part | Description |
| --------- | :-: | ---- | ----------- |
| Q1 | 1 | [2SC4081U3T106Q](https://octopart.com/2sc4081u3t106q-rohm-91418762) | NPN 50V 0.15A Bipolar Transistor SOT-323 SC-70 |
|  | 1 | [10129379-936001BLF](https://octopart.com/10129379-936001blf-amphenol+communications+solutions-126516413)<sup>[1]</sup> | 01x36 2.54mm Pitch Right Angle Header Pins |

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>[1]</sup>If you are making 2 adapters for Q2 and Q3 and/or the [X2 Adapter](../../X2%20Adapter/), you only need to buy one of the right angled header pins. 36 pins should be enough for the 3 small adapters.
