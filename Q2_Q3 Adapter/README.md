# Q2 Q3 Adapter
This adapter replaces the 2SC2021 transistors. This transistor is used for the clock circuit. You might have to adjust the cap trimmer (TC1 in OpenTendo) to get a stable clock (21.47727MHz for NTSC and 26.601712MHz for PAL).

## Gerber Files
There are two files in [Gerber Files](./Gerber%20Files/):
1. Single Board - Only consist of just one board.
2. Panelized - Consist of multiple board to fit in a 100mm x 100mm board. The panel have 90 (10x9) adapters. It is panelized using mouse bites.

## Assembly Tips
If you're using the right angle header pins, put the longer pins on the adapter side so you save a tiny bit of vertical space then you can just trim the pins off.
